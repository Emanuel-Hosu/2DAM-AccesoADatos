# 2DAM_AccesoADatos Repository

## What is this?

Welcome to the **2DAM_AccesoADatos** repository, where code meets practice... and sometimes, chaos! This is a collection of exercises, projects, and fun little experiments made for the **2nd year of the DAM (Development of Applications Multiplatform)** degree.

Think of this as the vault of our epic battles with Java, databases, and an occasional bug that refuses to leave us alone. üêõ

## Purpose

This repository is a place where all the assignments, exercises, and lessons from our **Access to Data** class live. It‚Äôs like a scrapbook of everything we've done and learned, with each folder and file telling the story of one more lesson conquered.

Feel free to dive into the code, laugh at the comments (yes, those were written under stress), and explore the journey of becoming better developers.

## Key Features

- **Java code**: You‚Äôll find plenty of Java, from simple exercises to more complex database connections.
- **SQL**: Yep, we've also wrangled with SQL queries. Expect some good ol‚Äô `SELECT` and `INSERT` statements sprinkled with confusion.
- **Errors**: Because no code is perfect, especially when written at 2 AM the night before it's due.
- **Learning moments**: Every bug is a feature in disguise. (Okay, not really. But we tell ourselves that to sleep at night.)

## Disclaimer

The code here is for learning purposes and probably shouldn't be used in production unless you're feeling lucky. üòÖ

## A Fun Reminder

Remember, even when you're deep in debugging, lost in a sea of semicolons and braces, you're not alone. There‚Äôs always coffee, Stack Overflow, and... well, this classic reminder:
